DataGridXL is a performant and reliable vanilla Javascript data grid with Excel-like controls.

## Main Features

### Performance First

DataGridXL is able to display thousands of rows and 60+ columns without a hiccup. Instead of useless features, your users get a performant grid. How's that for a change?

### Lightweight and Fashion-free

DataGridXL does not require any dependencies. No jQuery, no React, no Vue; simply no fashion. It's available in timeless Vanilla flavour only. It works today and it will work tomorrow.

### Familiar Interface

Your users will immediately know how to use DataGridXL, since common keyboard, mouse AND (readonly) touch controls are carefully copied from Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets.

### Works with CSV, JSON and 2D arrays

Support for all compatible formats. Import CSV data, display a large Javascript 2D array or a JSON array coming from database tables. Export options built-in.

### Reliable

DataGridXL carefully keeps a store & state. It means that reordering or moving columns/rows will never accidentally mess up your DOM.

## Usage

Include `datagridxl.js` in your web page HTML file:

```
<script src="https://code.datagridxl.com/datagridxl.js"></script>
```

Then create a new grid:

```
var options = {
	data: [...]
};
var grid = new DataGridXL("grid", options);
```
