description: excel is a very light jquery plugin to embed a spreadsheet, compatible with Excel, in your browser. You can load data straight to the table from a JS array, json or even a CSV file. You can copy and paste from or to Excel straight to jExcel. You can easily integrate with third party jquery plugins to create your own custom colums, custom editors, and others. And, it has a plenty of nice features such as key-value dropdown, CSV loading/exporting, multiple spreadsheets and much more. We have a large roadmap ahead and we are constantly improving, so don't forget to send us your ideas.
